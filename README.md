The "House Renting System" ASP.NET Core MVC App is a Web application for house renting. Users can look at all houses with their details, rent a house and look at their rented houses. They can also become Agents. Agents can add houses, see their details and edit and delete only houses they added. The Admin has all privileges of Users and Agents and can see all registrations in the app and all made rents.
